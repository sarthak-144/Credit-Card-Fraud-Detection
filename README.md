## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It addresses the challenge of **highly imbalanced data** (0.17% fraud rate) using advanced preprocessing and threshold tuning.

**Key Feature:** An interactive **Streamlit Dashboard** that allows users to adjust the decision threshold in real-time and visualize how it impacts Precision (Trust) and Recall (Catch Rate).

## 📊 The Data
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Size:** 284,807 transactions
- **Imbalance:** 492 Fraud (0.17%) vs. 284,315 Legitimate (99.83%)

### Class Imbalance
![Class Imbalance](images/class_imbalance.png)
*(The dataset is heavily skewed, requiring techniques like Class Weighting to solve.)*

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Preprocessing:** - `RobustScaler` applied to **Amount** to handle extreme outliers.
   - `StandardScaler` applied to **Time**.
2. **Resampling Strategy:** Used `stratified` splitting to ensure the test set maintains the 0.17% fraud ratio.
3. **Model Training:** Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with `class_weight='balanced'`.

## 🏆 Model Comparison (Leaderboard)
We evaluated three models to find the best balance between catching fraud (Recall) and minimizing false alarms (Precision).

| Model | Recall (Catch Rate) | Precision (Trust) | F1 Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | **91.8%** | 6.0% ❌ | 11.4% |
| **XGBoost** | 82.7% | 89.0% | **85.7%** |
| **Random Forest (Base)** | 75.5% | **96.1%** ✅ | 84.6% |

**Analysis:**
- **Logistic Regression** caught the most fraud but flagged too many innocent people (Low Precision).
- **Random Forest** was the most precise but missed some fraud.
- **Decision:** We chose **Random Forest** as the final model and optimized its decision threshold to improve its Recall.

## 🚀 Final Results (Tuned Random Forest)
By lowering the decision threshold from **0.5** to **0.3**, we significantly boosted the Catch Rate while keeping False Alarms low.

| Metric | Score (Class 1: Fraud) | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recall** | **0.82** | We catch 82% of all fraud cases. |
| **Precision** | **0.94** | When we flag a transaction, we are 94% accurate. |
| **F1-Score** | **0.87** | Excellent balance between the two. |
